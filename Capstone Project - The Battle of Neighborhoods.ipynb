    "The **West Stationery Company** (WSC) is expanding their business to the east of USA. During last three years, but it has not been as successful as expected. So, WSC have decided to open at the same time **3 new WSC Stationery Stores** at New York, with the main goal of revert this situation by start having enough presence in one of the most relevant cities of the World.\n",

    "1. **Geographic Information:** From library ***geopy.geocoders*** we'll obtaing any geographical coordinate from an address. We'll be able to locate New York city (to represent it with the related map). Also, address from venues (FourSquare) we'll help us in selecting the best position for the new WSC stores.\n",

    "2. **Neighborhoods:** From \n",
    "https://geo.nyu.edu/download/file/nyu-2451-34572-geojson.json, we'll take all neighborhood coordinates. At the beginning, we won't exclude any value. This coordinates will partition the city in enough small regions to allow a valid study. We cannot select the exact renting premise, but we can focus WSC infrastructure deparment in the right neighborhood.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3. **Population**: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/swpk-hqdp/files/88f17212-6c85-4e35-97ee-31f55fa81286?download=true&filename=New_York_City_Population_By_Neighborhood_Tabulation_Areas.xlsx, we'll obtain the populatino by neighborhood area. As we want a relevant impact from the beginning, it's important start in a very populated area.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "4. **Venues:** From https://www.foursquare.com API, we'll select all related educational centers for each neighborhood. Also, we will detect existing stationery stores and bookstores that will condition the sales for the new WSC stores.\n",
